    `useVirtualScroll`
  - **Error Boundaries**: `PerformanceErrorBoundary` with fallback handling
  - **Prefetch Utilities**: Resource prefetching on hover/focus
- **Impact**: Faster load times, better user experience, optimized resource
  usage

### 7. **Accessibility Implementation** ✅

- **Files Created**:
  - `src/shared/utils/accessibility.ts` - WCAG 2.1 AA utilities
  - `src/shared/components/AccessibilityComponents.tsx` - Accessible React
    components
- **Features Implemented**:
  - **Focus Management**: `useFocusTrap` for modals and dialogs
  - **Screen Reader Support**: `useScreenReader` with announcements
  - **Keyboard Navigation**: `useKeyboardNavigation` with full arrow key support
  - **Motion Preferences**: `useReducedMotion` for accessibility
  - **Accessible Components**: SkipLink, VisuallyHidden, LiveRegion, FocusTrap
  - **Semantic Components**: Proper heading hierarchy, landmark regions
  - **Progress Accessibility**: ARIA-compliant progress indicators
  - **Status Messages**: Role-based status announcements
- **Impact**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, inclusive user experience

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization:

- **TypeScript Errors**: 286+ errors across codebase
- **Component Duplication**: Multiple loading spinners, cards, modals
- **Responsive Issues**: Inconsistent breakpoint handling
- **Navigation Problems**: Basic routing without transitions or accessibility
- **Performance**: No lazy loading, bundle optimization, or image optimization
- **Accessibility**: Basic compliance, missing focus management

### After Optimization:

- **TypeScript Errors**: Minimal remaining (non-critical)
- **Component Duplication**: ✅ Eliminated - Single source of truth for all UI
  patterns
- **Responsive System**: ✅ Complete 320px-2560px coverage with 5 breakpoints
