-- Actually, let's be more specific and only allow these for social features
-- Let's drop the overly permissive policies and create more targeted ones

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow viewing achievements for profile viewing" ON public.user_achievements;

-- Create more specific policies that allow viewing when requested for social features
-- but still maintain privacy controls

-- These policies will work for both activity feed and profile viewing
-- The key is that users can see data from people they follow OR when viewing public profiles
